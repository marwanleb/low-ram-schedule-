# AGENT.md — driving `sched`

This is the whole interface for an agent populating Marwan's schedule. The app
never fetches anything by itself; nothing appears unless you put it there.

## The one rule that matters

**Every imported record needs a stable `external_id` that you derive from the
source, never generate randomly.** It is what makes a second run a no-op instead
of a second copy of everything.

    canvas:assignment:88213     good — stable across re-scans
    canvas:STAT240-pset-4          good — stable if the source names it that way
    a fresh uuid each run       WRONG — this is how the previous app ended up
                                posting every deadline twice

Re-running an identical import changes nothing. A record whose due date changed
updates in place. Items Marwan typed himself have no `external_id` and are never
touched by an import.

## Check before you add

    sched list --json
    sched export --json

Prefer `sched import` over repeated `sched add` for anything derived from an
external source: `add` has no key, so calling it twice really does create two
items. `add` is for one-off human-style capture.

## Import file

A JSON array. `external_id` and `title` are required; everything else optional.

```json
[
  {
    "external_id": "gcal:7f3a9c2e",
    "title": "STAT240 problem set 4",
    "due_at": "2026-09-04T23:59:00-05:00",
    "estimate_min": 120,
    "tags": ["math"]
  },
  {
    "external_id": "gcal:phys201",
    "title": "PHYS201",
    "tags": ["class"],
    "location": "Hall 2.106",
    "repeat": {
      "byday": ["mon", "wed"],
      "start_time": "10:30",
      "end_time": "12:00",
      "tz": "America/Chicago"
    }
  }
]
```

Then:

    sched import schedule.json

**`repeat` is how a timetable goes in.** A weekly class is one record with a
repeat rule, not fifteen dated copies — one row that renders every week and can
be edited in one place. An item with a `repeat` is treated as a commitment: it
occupies the week and stays out of the to-do list.

- `byday` — any of `mon tue wed thu fri sat sun`, at least one.
- `start_time` / `end_time` — 24-hour `HH:MM`, wall clock.
- `tz` — an IANA name (`America/Chicago`, `Europe/Paris`, `Asia/Beirut`). It
  fixes the class to that city's clock, so it still reads correctly from
  another country. Omit it and the time follows whatever machine is showing it,
  which is what you want for something like a wake-up alarm. **Never an
  abbreviation** — `CT` is rejected.
- Dropping `repeat` on a later import removes the rule, so a cancelled class
  stops appearing.

`due_at` is for one-off deadlines and wants a full RFC3339 timestamp including
the offset. `tags` are free-form; the four that also set a display colour are
`work`, `life`, `body`, `social`.

The batch applies completely or not at all. A record missing `external_id`, or
carrying an unknown time zone, is refused and **nothing** is written — a
half-applied import is worse than a failed one, because it looks like it worked.

## Where to put the file, and how to run it

`sched.exe` lives beside the app:

    %USERPROFILE%\marwans-schedule\sched.exe

From a source checkout it is `target\release\sched.exe` instead. Either way,
import files go in a dated run directory next to the binary:

    sched-sync\runs\<YYYY-MM-DD>\import.json

One directory per sync, named for the date it was produced. A run is then
something you can look at afterwards, re-apply verbatim, or diff against the
next one — and because every record carries an `external_id`, re-applying an
old run is harmless.

### PowerShell

```powershell
Set-Location "$env:USERPROFILE\marwans-schedule"
.\sched.exe import sched-sync\runs\2026-09-09\import.json
```

```
imported  2 added, 0 updated
```

Run it again on the same file and it says `0 added, 2 updated`. That is the
whole point: re-running is safe.

Four things trip agents up on Windows, all of them avoidable:

- **`.\` is required.** PowerShell will not run an executable from the current
  directory without it. Bare `sched.exe import ...` fails unless the folder is
  on `PATH`.
- **`cd /d` is cmd.exe, not PowerShell.** Use `Set-Location`, or plain `cd`.
- **`&&` does not chain commands in Windows PowerShell 5.1.** Use `;`, or
  `if ($?) { ... }` when the second should only run if the first succeeded.
- **Write the JSON without a byte-order mark.** `Set-Content -Encoding utf8`
  and `Out-File -Encoding utf8` both prepend one in 5.1, and the import is then
  refused with `expected value at line 1 column 1`, which does not hint at the
  cause. Write it this way instead:

  ```powershell
  [System.IO.File]::WriteAllText("$run\import.json", $json)
  ```

### Rehearse against a scratch store first

`--db` points at any file, so a run can be applied somewhere harmless and
inspected before it goes near the real store:

```powershell
$scratch = "$env:TEMP\dry-run.db"
Remove-Item $scratch -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
.\sched.exe --db $scratch import sched-sync\runs\2026-09-09\import.json
.\sched.exe --db $scratch week
```

If that reads correctly, run the same command again without `--db`.

### Other shells

In bash or zsh it is `./sched import sched-sync/runs/2026-09-09/import.json`,
and none of the four traps apply.

## Commands

    sched add "<text>"          capture one line, same syntax as the app
    sched list [--today]        open items
    sched week [--on DATE]      the week's schedule
    sched done "<title start>"  tick off; refuses if the prefix is ambiguous
    sched except <id> <date>    cancel one occurrence of a repeat
    sched rm <id>               delete
    sched import <file.json>    bulk upsert (see above)
    sched export                every item as JSON
    sched stats [--tag T]       how much longer things take than estimated
    sched help                  syntax reference

Add `--json` to any read command for machine-readable output. `--db <path>`
targets a specific store; the default is the app's own.

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` refused (bad input, nothing written), `2` not found
or ambiguous.

## Capture syntax

`sched add` uses exactly the same parser as the app and the Telegram bot, so
anything below also works when typed by hand.

```
Type what you want to remember. Plain text always works:

> renew parking

Add details on the end. Anything the parser does not recognise stays
in the title, so ordinary sentences are safe.

Commands:

  help          this text
  list          everything still open
  list today    due today or overdue
  list week     due in the next seven days
  week          this week's schedule
  done: <text>  tick off the first task matching <text>

A line with no date is read back to you before it is filed, so something
sent in a hurry does not quietly become a task with no when.

Ten minutes before anything on the week starts, or anything in the list
falls due, this chat gets a reminder. Nothing to switch on — it pushes to
whoever last spoke to it.
```

## What not to do

- Do not invent deadlines. Only add what you actually found.
- Do not use `add` in a loop over scraped data; use `import`.
- Do not retry a failed `import` by switching to `add` — fix the record and
  re-run the import, which is safe.
