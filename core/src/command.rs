Add details on the end. Anything the parser does not recognise stays
in the title, so ordinary sentences are safe.

Commands:

  help          this text
  list          everything still open
  list today    due today or overdue
  list week     due in the next seven days
  week          this week's schedule
  done: <text>  tick off the first task matching <text>

Leave things out and you are asked for them one at a time — when, what
time, how long — and `-` skips any of them. A complete line is never
questioned, so the asking is the price of being terse rather than a tax
on every capture. Send `cancel` to drop a half-finished one.

Ten minutes before anything on the week starts, or anything in the list
falls due, this chat gets a reminder. Nothing to switch on — it pushes to
whoever last spoke to it.
